    "bio": "Hill is back in New Orleans and, while technically a quarterback on the roster, he will continue to operate as a gadget player and thus has tight end eligibility in ESPN Fantasy leagues. In two full regular seasons on the roster, Hill has registered 13 pass attempts, 64 carries and 22 receptions. He caught six touchdowns during the 2019 regular season, but those six came on seven targets inside the 10-yard line, which is obviously unsustainable. Hill's role allowed him no fantasy value when designiated as a QB (one weekly finish better than 18th), but his 2019 point total would've ranked 21st at tight end. He's on the TE2 radar in deep leagues. Note that Hill will be stripped of TE/Flex eligibility and changed to a QB if positioned as the Saints' starter at any point this season.",

Despite appearing in 15 games, Trubisky was limited to only three top-10 fantasy weeks and finished 26th in points by season's end. The 25-year-old is barely worth QB2 consideration as a starter, so with Foles lingering, he's obviously well off the fantasy radar.",

Tagovailoa is on the small side (6-foot, 217 pounds) but is a terrific decision-maker with excellent pocket presence and accuracy. His 2019 numbers were outstanding, with his 206.9 QB rating best in class and his 94.8 total QBR just behind Burrow's. Tagovailoa has QB1 upside down the road, but he might open his career behind Ryan Fitzpatrick and is unlikely to land on the fantasy radar in a rebuilding Miami offense.",

Darnold hasn't been afraid to push the ball down the field (8.9 aDOT), but he adds little with his legs and has made little fantasy impact. The 2018 third overall pick posted four top-10 fantasy weeks but was 20th or worse in eight of his other nine outings last season. With an improved line and Chris Herndon back, Darnold's supporting cast is better in 2020, but he'll need a giant leap in order to come close to the QB1 discussion.",

Hurts is also fresh off an outstanding 2019 season as a passer, when he was off target on only 8.3% of his throws (second-best in this class) and averaged 11.3 YPA (best) despite a 10.2 aDOT (second-highest). Hurts' accuracy needs work, but he's tough and avoids turnovers. Similar in style to Tyrod Taylor, Hurts has a shot to flirt with QB1 numbers once called upon to start.
